# FIFO and LIFO librairies

Result of a practical work during our first study year in our engineering school ISIMA (Institut Supérieur d'Informatique et Modélisation de ses Applications). Realised during March 2019. Consists in C libraries implementing FIFO and LIFO functions. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need a linux shell for the compilation and the launch of the executable program (ex: bash).

### Compilation

Use the Makefile to compile the executable program with the following command :

```
make
```

### Program execution

Once the executable program compiled, you will be able to launch him with the following command :

```
./prog
```
